The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h3>Exploratory analysis</h3>
<p>First, we examine how the day of the year (doy) at which the maximum
peak occurs varies throughout the years for each species and site. We
create a custom function to generate a plot for each species faceted by
site. All the pdfs generated are stored <a

<h2>Compute trends</h2>
<p>We analyze the temporal trend of the date at which the peak flight
occurs (DOY). We calculate the trends using both the Mann-Kendall and
Sen’s slope methods, as well as linear methods, to assess how the DOY
varies over time. We specifically focus on species where we have at
least 5 data points, indicating that the species has been observed for a
minimum of 5 years.</p>
